=================

Subversion hook that sends events to Flowdock

If you already know about Ruby and Subversion commit hooks,
[flowdock-commit-hook.rb](https://github.com/flowdock/flowdock-svn-hook/raw/master/hooks/flowdock-commit-hook.rb)
is what you are looking for.

### Requirements

This software needs to be available for the user that hosts the repository.

* ruby - _1.8.7 and 1.9.x are supported_

  Install or update using your OS's package manager or follow the instructions
  at [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
  Note, that using rvm could be tricky, because commit hooks are not run on
  [a real shell environment](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html#svn-ch-5-sect-2.1)!

* rubygems - _only for 1.8.7, rubygems is included in standard 1.9.x ruby_

  Follow the installation instructions at [https://rubygems.org/pages/download](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).

  TL;DR; Currently:

        wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-2.4.5.zip
        unzip rubygems-1.8.24.zip
        cd rubygems-1.8.24
        ruby setup.rb

* svn and multi_json gems

        gem install svn multi_json --no-ri --no-rdoc

  NOTE: The current version of the svn gem (0.2.0) is broken on some operating
  systems including Mac OS X and RedHat Enterprise Linux/CentOS. You need to
  install the gem manually from Github sources.

### Install

Find out where your repository is located in the filesystem. We'll refer to its
`hooks` subdirectory as HOOKS_DIR later on.

Copy [flowdock-commit-hook.rb](https://github.com/flowdock/flowdock-svn-hook/raw/master/hooks/flowdock-commit-hook.rb)
to your HOOKS_DIR.

Change the configuration variables at the top of the flowdock-commit-hook.rb file:

* FLOW_TOKEN (mandatory)

  Log in to Flowdock and create a source by clicking on the cog wheel next to the current flow's name in the sidebar. Choose Integrations, find Subversion from the list and click Add new. The token can be created there.

* REPOSITORY_NAME (optional)

  Used in the team inbox as a source name. If it's nil, then the directory name of
  the repository is used (`/var/www/repos/foo` will show up as `foo`).

* REPOSITORY_URL (optional)

  Used in the team inbox as a link to the project source.
  Eg. `https://svn.example.com/repository/trunk`

* REVISION_URL (optional)

  Used in team inbox messages as a link to a specific revision. The string
  `:revision` is replaced with the revision number. E.g.
  `http://svn.example.com/repo/trunk?p=:revision` with r1234 becomes a link to
  `http://svn.example.com/repo/trunk?p=1234` in Flowdock team inbox.

* USERS (optional)

  Map your Subversion usernames to real names and email addresses.
  Flowdock uses these to enrich your team inbox messages' default content.

* TAGS (optional)

  Specify a set of tags to be added to each team inbox message from this 
  repository. Should be entered as an array of strings. No # character is 
  necessary for the tags.

* VERIFY_SSL (optional)

  Set this to false if you do not care that some third party might get
  ahold of your flow token.

In case you don't yet have post commit scripts, you have to create the invoking
script:

    cat > HOOKS_DIR/post-commit <<EOF
    #!/bin/sh
    EOF
    chmod u+x HOOKS_DIR/post-commit

Add this line at the bottom of HOOKS_DIR/post-commit file

    ruby HOOKS_DIR/flowdock-commit-hook.rb "$1" "$2"

where 'ruby' is an absolute path to your installed ruby interpreter.

### Notes

To get the most out of the Flowdock post commit hook, we encourage you to
follow [SVN best practices](http://blog.evanweaver.com/2007/08/15/svn-branching-best-practices-in-practice/).

By the way, there is also another SCM tool, [Git](http://git-scm.org).
